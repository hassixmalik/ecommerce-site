Functional Requirements:
1. **Pothole Reporting:** The system must allow citizens to log in and report potholes by providing the location and severity information. This information should be stored in the database.

2. **Pothole Logging:** Each reported pothole should be logged in the "public works department repair system" with a unique identifying number, along with details such as street address, size, location, district, and repair priority.

3. **Work Order Management:** The system should manage work orders for pothole repairs, including tracking pothole location and size, assigning repair crews, recording crew details, equipment allocation, repair status, material usage, and cost calculation.

4. **Damage Reporting:** The system should allow citizens to report damage caused by potholes, capturing information like the citizen's name, address, phone number, type of damage, and the dollar amount of damage.

5. **Interactive Queries:** The system should support interactive queries to retrieve information about potholes, their repair status, damage reports, and associated data.

Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Usability:** The system should have an intuitive user interface and provide an easy-to-use experience for citizens reporting potholes and public works personnel managing repairs.

2. **Performance:** The system must respond to user requests promptly and handle a large volume of pothole reports and repair data efficiently.

3. **Security:** Data in the system, including citizen information and repair data, should be securely stored and only accessible by authorized personnel. It should also ensure the privacy of citizens reporting potholes.

4. **Reliability:** The system should be available 24/7, with minimal downtime for maintenance, to ensure that citizens can report potholes at any time.

5. **Scalability:** The system should be designed to scale as the number of reported potholes and repair requests increase, without a significant degradation in performance.

These requirements encompass the core functionality of the Pothole Tracking and Repair System (PHTRS) and address various non-functional aspects to ensure a robust and user-friendly system.
